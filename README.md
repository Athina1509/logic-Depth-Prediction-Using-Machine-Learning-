# logic-Depth-Prediction-Using-Machine-Learning-
This project uses Machine Learning to predict the logic depth of digital circuits, reducing the time taken by traditional synthesis tools. A Random Forest Regressor model is trained using key features such as Fan-In, Fan-Out, and Gate Type to provide fast and accurate predictions.
